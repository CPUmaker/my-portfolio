Ghost Tactics is an innovative auto chess experience that emphasizes lightweight player strategy and real-time 3D combat mechanics, playable both online and offline. It is developed using a tech stack comprising **Unity 3D** and **C#** for the frontend, with support for Android and PC, and **Django** on Python with a **MySQL** database for the backend. Key features include AI battles without internet connectivity, 3D real-time battle scenes for enhanced expressiveness, and a simplified multiplayer online system for easy game room joining and hosting.

**Key Feature of the Project**: Unlike traditional auto chess games, our game focuses on in-game lightweight player strategies and combat mechanisms, allowing players to quickly load the game and engage in AI battles without needing an internet connection. At the same time, the 3D real-time battle scenes enhance the expressiveness of the game, and online support allows players to join the same game room directly for gameplay. Overall, our advantages lie in innovative gameplay and game forms.

**Competitive Product Comparison**: The mobile game "Teamfight Tactics" has too much randomness, and players cannot freely assemble cards. We introduced a card system to enhance the freedom of player decision-making. While "Hearthstone" has turn-based combat, thus lacking unnecessary 3D effects, our game features real-time battles, using 3D scenes and adding combat special effects and sound effects to enhance the game's expressiveness.

In terms of multiplayer online, our game simplifies the complex online/matching mechanisms found in other games. Players can play together through a host-player mode. In the multiplayer online interface, users can choose to create a room with a specified ID to become the host, or join an existing room as a regular player by entering its ID. The host can initiate the start of the game. If one player leaves the game scene, both will return to the battle room, and if the host exits, the other player will become the new host to maintain room resources.
