## In-Memory File System Project

This project showcases the development of an advanced In-Memory File System implemented in Java, designed to simulate the core functionalities of a conventional file system within the RAM for fast, efficient data access and manipulation. The system is architected to support hierarchical file management, including the creation, deletion, reading, and writing of files and directories in a simulated environment.

### Key Features

- **Hierarchical Structure**: Emulates the traditional file system structure, allowing for nested directories and files, mirroring real-world file system organization.
- **Efficient Data Management**: Implements optimized data structures and algorithms for rapid access and modification of files and directories, ensuring high performance for all operations.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Offers a straightforward API for interacting with the file system, making it accessible for applications to perform file operations without dealing with the complexities of physical file system management.
- **Versatile File Operations**: Supports a comprehensive set of operations such as creating, deleting, reading from, and writing to files, alongside querying and updating directory contents.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Incorporates sophisticated error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage exceptions and invalid operations, ensuring the system's reliability and stability.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in Java and my ability to design and implement complex systems with attention to efficiency, usability, and reliability. It serves as a testament to my skills in software development, problem-solving, and creating scalable and maintainable code structures.
